# Task 8 - K-Means Clustering

This project performs unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Features Used
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## What This Project Does
- Loads and visualizes the dataset.
- Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Performs K-Means clustering.
- Visualizes the clusters.
- Evaluates clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.

## Output
- Elbow plot showing optimal `K`
- Cluster scatter plot
- Silhouette Score printed in the console

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and place it in the same folder as the script.
2. Run the script using any Python IDE :
   ```bash
   python Task8_Clustering_with_K_Means.py
